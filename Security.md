# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the following:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.** Instead, email us directly at [security@freedomproject.ai](mailto:security@freedomproject.ai).
2. Include detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability and any potential impacts.
3. We will investigate within 72 hours and respond with remediation steps or acknowledgment.

All disclosures will be acknowledged publicly only after a patch is available and responsible disclosure timelines are respected.

## Secure Development Practices
- We use **dependabot** for automated dependency updates.
- All code is reviewed and scanned for common vulnerabilities.
- Tokens, keys, and secrets are never committed to the repository.

Thank you for helping us keep The Freedom Project secure.
